            <h2>What are the Finger Lakes?</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">Welcome to the Finger Lakes! The Finger Lakes are located directly south of Lake Ontario in what is known as the 
                Finger Lake Region. 
                The Finger Lakes include eleven thin and long lakes all going from north to south. They are called the Finger Lakes 
                due to their appearance, long, thin, and narrow streams. 
                The lakes consist of beautiful gorges, waterfalls, and deep and stunningly clear water. There are also many 
                small ponds around the lakes, nice for tourists to explore more. The nearest cities around the beautiful lakes are 
                Rochester,
                 the biggest city in the finger lakes region, and Syracuse. Lastly, when it comes to worries about transportation, 
                New York has got you covered. 
                There are accessible trains and even airlines that fly directly to the finger lakes.</p>

            <h2>History Behind the Finger Lakes</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">The history behind the Finger Lakes goes nearly 2 million years back. Sometime back then, there was a massive glacier moving across what we 
                know today as New York. As the glacier went across the land, it left massive trenches in the ground, forming what we know today as the finger 
                lakes. Cayuga and Seneca Lake are the deepest lakes. There were also many early settlers around the Finger Lakes. The land was built upon by 
                the Iroquois tribe. The Iroquois were among the most powerful tribes before colonization, and defended the land and themselves from the 
                Europeans for a long time. Unfortunately for the Iroquois, a war between the British and Americans lead to a civil war in Indian society. 
                This left them vulnerable and after the Revolutionary War, the Finger Lakes land was open for purchase.</p>

            <h2>Environment</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">The environment of the Finger Lakes, as known before, consists of eleven lakes. These lakes are full of rich material, most consistently found 
                bedrock, interglacial deposits and plenty of shale. The shale is actually quite a concern unfortunately, due to the fracking technology and the 
                Finger Lakes being right above a massive natural gas reserve. 
                The Finger Lakes however, boast gorgeous forests, lakes, ponds, and even glacial reserves. The Finger Lakes National Forest sits alongside the
                 lakes, and is the only national forest in the state of New York. The weather and soil is also perfect for vineyards. In fact, the oldest vineyard on
                the east of the United States is located right on the Conesus Lake!</p>

            <h2>Culture and Activities</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">The Finger Lakes have amazing activities and is a perfect tourist destination. When it comes to the lakes, you can always go swimming, kayaking, 
                or any aquatic activity. Also in the fantastic forest, you can go hiking on one of the many paths all ranging in difficulty to provide for experience. 
                
                There are also many leisure activities for the tourist that would like to keep it more mellow. As said before, this region produces fantastic wine, 
                with over 400 wineries around the eastern lakes. Don’t fear if you are not a wine guy, for there is plenty of beer! There are also many craft beer 
                spots on the lakes. Additionally, there are many amazing museums around the region including, Finger Lakes Boating Museum, Johnson Museum 
                of Art, the Sciencenter, and so many more. </p>
